        <h2>Meet the Explorer</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Alex! With over six years of exploring hidden spaces, I've learned that every abandoned building has a unique story. Through this site, I hope to capture that magic and share it with fellow adventurers.

        <h2>How It Began</h2>
        <p>
          My very first explore was a forgotten train station tucked behind overgrown tracks. That spark of excitement ignited a lifelong passion to document the mysterious, the beautiful, and the eerie within urban spaces.
